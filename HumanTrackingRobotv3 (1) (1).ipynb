    "# Tutorial 5 -- Human Detection \n",
    "This tutorial will show you how to detect human with the robot. We will use multi-thread to capture the color images and depth images. Then the ssd mobilenet v2 nerual network structure is used for human detection. To enable real-time performance, the tensorRT deep learning framework is used.
